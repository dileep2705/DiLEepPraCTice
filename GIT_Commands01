Linux is an operating system which was developed to be used as an alternative to other existing but expansive operating systems specially Unix, Windows, Mac OS, MS-DOS, Solaris and others. When Linus Torvalds was studying at the University of Helsinki, decided to create his own operating system and keep it as Open Sources so that users from around the world can contribute their suggestions for improvements.
